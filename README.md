# p5-focal

a simple website portfolio with a [p5.js](https://p5js.org) sketch as the focal point

**Getting started**

This is a simple website, so only a basic understanding of `html` and `css` is needed. If you want to take advantage of the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) sketch, then you'll also need to know `javascript`.

To get started using this site, follow the below steps.

1. First, clone this repository.

  `git clone https://github.com/marshalhayes/p5-focal`

  This will create a folder called `p5-focal` in your current working directory.
2. Text and links on the site can easily be changed by editing the `index.html` file.
3. Once you've made all the desired changes, push your code to GitHub and set it up with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

**Running the site locally**

No server is needed to display the content of the site, but it is recommended to use one since this is how everyone will be viewing your site. To run the site with a local server, you can use packages like the Python `SimpleHTTPServer` or the node module `http-server`.

My preference is `http-server`. If you already have `node` installed, you can simply install `http-server`:

`npm i -g http-server`

If you don't have `node` installed, [install it](https://nodejs.org/) and then run the above command.

After both installs complete, open a terminal and run `http-server -c-1` in the site's root directory.

**Using the code**

Use it however you like! Do checkout the [LICENSE](LICENSE) first.
